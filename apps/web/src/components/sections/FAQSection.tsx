    title: "Pre-Project Questions",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How can you build quality applications so fast?",
        answer: "AI-powered development handles repetitive coding tasks while our developers focus on your unique requirements. We use proven frameworks and standardized processes refined over dozens of projects."
      },
      {
        question: "What types of applications can you build?",
        answer: "Micro-SaaS applications with user authentication, payments, and 3-5 core features. Think task management, analytics dashboards, booking systems, or content platforms. Complex enterprise integrations fall outside our scope."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you sign an NDA?",
        answer: "Yes, we sign NDAs before discussing your project details."
      },
      {
        question: "What technologies do you use?",
        answer: "Next.js 15 with TypeScript and App Router for frontend. Express.js API with Supabase PostgreSQL database. Vercel for hosting. This stack handles authentication, payments, and real-time features out of the box."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you work with international clients?",
        answer: "Yes. We invoice in USD and accept international wire transfers. All communication happens via email and video calls."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I'm not technicalâ€”can I still work with you?",
        answer: "Yes. We handle all technical aspects and provide clear documentation. However, you'll need someone technical for ongoing maintenance and future development."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Project Delivery Questions",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "What happens if you can't deliver in 14 days?",
        answer: "We aim for 14-day delivery but work in 2-week sprints. If your project requires additional development time, we complete it within 28 days total at no extra cost. We communicate timeline expectations clearly during our initial consultation."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I need changes during the 14-day build?",
        answer: "Minor adjustments to the agreed scope are included. Major changes or additional features are handled as separate projects to maintain our timeline."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you handle project scope creep?",
        answer: "We define exact scope during our initial call and stick to it. Any requests outside the agreed scope are quoted separately as new work."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Post-Delivery Questions",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Who owns the code and intellectual property?",
        answer: "You own everything. Complete source code, database, and all intellectual property transfer to you on delivery day."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide ongoing hosting?",
        answer: "We offer two options: (1) Managed hosting service for $127/month plus infrastructure costs (Vercel Pro $20/month, Supabase Pro $25/month) where we handle everything, or (2) We set up hosting on your accounts and you manage it yourself with our documentation."
      },
      {
        question: "What if something breaks after delivery?",
        answer: "Critical bugs within 7 days of delivery are fixed free. After that, our Technical Support package ($247/month) covers ongoing maintenance and bug fixes."
      },
      {
        question: "How do ongoing iterations work toward product-market fit?",
        answer: "Quick iteration cycles are critical for finding product-market fit - you need to rapidly test, measure, and improve based on real user behavior. We're currently exploring the best pricing model for post-MVP iterations to ensure it aligns with your success. We can discuss specific options and pricing during your discovery call, as we have a few promising approaches we're evaluating."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I take the code to another developer team?",
        answer: "Absolutely. You get complete source code ownership and technical documentation. Any developer can take over from where we left off."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you handle marketing or user acquisition?",
        answer: "No. We build the application. Marketing, user acquisition, and launch strategy are entirely your responsibility."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you integrate with my existing systems?",
        answer: "Simple API integrations (Stripe, email services, analytics) are possible. Complex enterprise integrations fall outside our beta scope - we'll refer you to specialists."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Pricing and Payment Questions",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer: "We invoice via Xero and accept international wire transfers. Payment is required before we start work."
      },
      {
        question: "Are there any hidden costs?",
        answer: "No. Our pricing is transparent. The only ongoing costs are optional hosting ($127/month) and support services ($247/month) if you choose them."
      },
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Beta Program Questions",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "What does \"beta launch special\" mean?",
        answer: "We're fine-tuning our processes and looking for collaborative founders who understand we're perfecting our system together. In exchange, you get significant savings on our standard pricing."
      },
      {
        question: "How many projects do you take on each month?",
        answer: "We limit projects to ensure quality and maintain our 14-day delivery promise. Current availability is shown on our pricing page."
      },
      {
        question: "What makes a good beta client?",
        answer: "Founders who are responsive to feedback, communicate quickly, understand the building process, and are excited about trying new approaches to rapid development."
